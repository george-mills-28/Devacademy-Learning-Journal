Command line reflection:

Command line is like using the file explorer in windows where you can read, create and delete, things of the nature.
But, instead of clicking through your typing through. For example to open a file in explorer you'd just have to click it twice, whereas in terminal you could use "cat (file name)" to show the content of said file.

Timebox guidelines:
I went through everything much faster than the guidelines, so I had time to go back over everything and double check I understood it all.

5 commands:
mkdir - Makes a directory 
rm -rf - Deletes a directory 
touch - creates a file .txt .pdf
cat - reads/displays contents of a file in terminal
cd .. - changes to the previous directory

Unexpected Learning:
Everything I learned today was completely new to me but I found it very intuitive and easy to pick up. I think the unexpected thing for me was how fast I picked it up.
